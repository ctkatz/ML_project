## Abstract

Our project will identify umpire bias in baseball by analyzing pitch 
location and outcomes by pitch. We want to understand what makes an umpire 
more accurate at calling strikes through situational outcomes and player
demographics, including team, race and home country. This is a binary 
classification problem and we will be looking at data with a lot of features
and trying to figure out which of these attributes effect bias the most. 
We propose to evaluate our sucess by subsetting our data and testing it 
to see the true accuracy of our model on actual game data.

## Motivation

Robot umpires are in the hole. If actual umpires strike out, it will be their
time to bat. If we have a sucessful model, we can understand what attributes
cause umpires to be more biased. The more sucessful the model is, the more umpire 
bias will be evident.

## Planned Deliverables

Using data that includes information about the phyiscs of the pitch such as launch speed, direction, and angle as well as information about the current state of the game we will develop a model that predicts whethor or not the umpire will make the correct call; we have the information of the actual location of the ball as it crosses home plate, so we know what the call should of been and we also have the call the umpire makes. Thus, we will develop a model that predicts whether or not the umpire will make the correct call. A majority of the work for our project will be in analyzing partitions of the data to explore factors which may affect the umpire's ability to make the correct call, such as pressure in late game scenarios or in demographic bias towards the batter or the pitcher. Of course, pitches on the outside of the box will be less likely to be called correctly but there may be other nuances in the model that could be interesting to explore.
