## Abstract

## Motivation

## Planned Deliverables
Using data that includes information about the phyiscs of the pitch such as launch speed, direction, and angle as well as information about the current state of the game we will develop a model that predicts whethor or not the umpire will make the correct call; we have the information of the actual location of the ball as it crosses home plate, so we know what the call should of been and we also have the call the umpire makes. Thus, we will develop a model that predicts whether or not the umpire will make the correct call. A majority of the work for our project will be in analyzing partitions of the data to explore factors which may affect the umpire's ability to make the correct call, such as pressure in late game scenarios or in demographic bias towards the batter or the pitcher. Of course, pitches on the outside of the box will be less likely to be called correctly but there may be other nuances in the model that could be interesting to explore.
